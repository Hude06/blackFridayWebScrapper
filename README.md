# A Simple Black Friday Web Scrapper for amaon

In this project I made a simple project that use puppeter to seach the web for the best deals on amazon for black friday. It first asks for the users input and then seaches that on amazon then gets all the reluts titles original prices and the new prices and then calculates a fraction. Then the program calculates which item has the best fraction or discount and then displays it to you
