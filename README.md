In this project, I made a simple application that uses Puppeteer to search the web for the best deals on Amazon for Black Friday. It first asks for the user's input and then searches that on Amazon, retrieving all the results' titles, original prices, and the new prices. Afterward, it calculates a fraction. The program then determines which item has the best fraction or discount and displays it to you.

To try out the program, you have to initialize an npm project with `npm init` and then install all the dependencies with `npm install`. Finally, you can run it with `npm app.js`.
